The first node needs to be a CAR MODEL, the second an IMAGE.\n* Requests are rejected with a `404` error when no `has-prime-image` relationship exists between both nodes.\n* The relationship is successfully deleted when it actually exists. â†’ Status code `204`.\n\n# Scope & Limits\n\n* No authorization at the moment. Everyone can delete the relationship.\n",
