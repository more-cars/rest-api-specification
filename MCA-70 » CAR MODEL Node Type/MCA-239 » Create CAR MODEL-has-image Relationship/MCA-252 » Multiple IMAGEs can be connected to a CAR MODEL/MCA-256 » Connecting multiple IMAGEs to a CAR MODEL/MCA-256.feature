@REQ_MCA-239
Feature: Create CAR MODEL-has-image Relationship
  As an API contributor\
  I want to be able to attach IMAGES to CAR MODELS\
  So an API consumer can illustrate CAR MODEL nodes in a frontend application

  @RULE_MCA-252
  Rule: Multiple IMAGEs can be connected to a CAR MODEL

    @TEST_MCA-256 @implemented
    Scenario: Connecting multiple IMAGEs to a CAR MODEL
      Given there exists a "CAR MODEL" "Impreza"
      And there exists an "IMAGE" "rear spoiler"
      And there exists an "IMAGE" "bonnet"
      And there exists an "IMAGE" "interior"
      When the user connects "IMAGE" "rear spoiler" to "CAR MODEL" "Impreza"
      And the user connects "IMAGE" "bonnet" to "CAR MODEL" "Impreza"
      And the user connects "IMAGE" "interior" to "CAR MODEL" "Impreza"
      Then the IMAGE "rear spoiler" should be connected to the CAR MODEL "Impreza"
      And the IMAGE "bonnet" should be connected to the CAR MODEL "Impreza"
      And the IMAGE "interior" should be connected to the CAR MODEL "Impreza"
