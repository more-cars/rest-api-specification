  "description": "# Specification\n\n* Requests are rejected with a `404` error when the CAR MODEL, the IMAGE or both don't exist.\n* Requests are rejected with a `404` error when a node with the given ID actually exists, but does not have the correct type. The first node needs to be a CAR MODEL, the second an IMAGE.\n* The relationship is successfully created when both nodes exist and are from the correct type. → Status code `201`.\n  * A JSON object is returned confirming that both entities have been connected:\n    * `car_model_id`: integer\n    * `image_id`: integer\n    * `relationship_id`: integer\n    * `relationship_name`: string → `has-prime-image`\n* The user can trigger the creation of the same relationship multiple times. The result is always the same:\n  * same status code\n  * same structure\n  * same data\n  * **same relationship ID**\n  * ⚠️ The relationship may not be deleted in the process! The app has to return the already existing relationship!\n* A CAR MODEL can only have **one** prime IMAGE, not multiple.\n  * Creating a different relationship automatically deletes the previous relationship.\n\n# Scope & Limits\n\n* No authorization at the moment. Everyone can create the relationship.\n* TBD: Can the prime image be every image? Does it have to come from the image gallery? Is it added automatically to the gallery, if not?\n",
