This can happen when there exist no nodes with the given IDs or when those nodes are from the wrong type. -> Status Code \\`404\\`\n* The same ›has-image‹ relationship between the same nodes can only be created once. Attempts to recreate them will be ignored. -> Status Code \\`304\\`\n* Each BRAND can be in a ›has-image‹ relationship with multiple IMAGES\n",
