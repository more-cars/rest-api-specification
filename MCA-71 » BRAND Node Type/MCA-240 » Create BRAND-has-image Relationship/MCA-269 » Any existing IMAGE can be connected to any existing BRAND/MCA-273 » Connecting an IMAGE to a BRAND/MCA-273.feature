  As an API contributor\
  I want to be able to attach IMAGEs to BRANDs\
  So I can illustrate them

    Scenario: Connecting an IMAGE to a BRAND
      Given there exists a "BRAND" "Maserati"
      And there exists an "IMAGE" "logo"
      When the user connects "IMAGE" "logo" to "BRAND" "Maserati"
      Then the response should return with status code 201
