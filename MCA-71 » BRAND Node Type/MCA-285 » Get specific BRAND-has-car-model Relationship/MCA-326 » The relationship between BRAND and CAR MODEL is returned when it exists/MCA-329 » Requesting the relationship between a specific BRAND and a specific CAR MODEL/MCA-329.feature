  As an API contributor\

  So I can find out if they are already connected or not

    @TEST_MCA-329 @implemented
    Scenario: Requesting the relationship between a specific BRAND and a specific CAR MODEL
      Given there exists a "BRAND" "Lamborghini"
      And there exists a "CAR MODEL" "Countach"
      And there exists a relationship "R" between "BRAND" "Lamborghini" and "CAR MODEL" "Countach"
      When the user requests the relationship between "BRAND" "Lamborghini" and "CAR MODEL" "Countach"
      Then the response should return with status code 200
      And the response should return the relationship "R"
