  "description": "* for an admin it should be possible to restrict environment access via basic auth\n* an admin should be able to configure each environment independently&#x20;\n  * activate/deactivate basic auth\n  * define a set of basic auth credentials\n* for each environment only one set of basic auth credentials is required (not every user or user group needs one)\n  * whoever has the credentials can enter the environment (but not necessarily access the API → see MCA-645)\n* when basic auth is activated&#x20;\n  * when the API user provides valid credentials&#x20;\n    * then access is granted and the request is processed\n    * the (positive) authentication status has no impact on the HTTP status code\n  * when the API user provides invalid credentials (or none at all)\n    * then access is denied and the request is not processed\n    * status code is \\`401\\`\n* this mechanic should work for a local environment, in minikube and in gke\n",
