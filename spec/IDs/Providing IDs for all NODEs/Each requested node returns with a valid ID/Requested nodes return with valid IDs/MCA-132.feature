@REQ_MCA-84
Feature: Providing IDs for all NODEs
  As an API consumer\
  I need all NODEs to have an IDENTIFIER\
  So I can find the NODEs again to reference them in different contexts

  @RULE_MCA-101
  Rule: Each requested node returns with a valid ID

    @TEST_MCA-132 @implemented
    Scenario Outline: Requested nodes return with valid IDs
      Given there exist 8 "<node type>"s
      When the user requests an existing "<node type>"
      Then the property "id" in the response should be a number greater than 0
      And the property "id" in the response should be a number lesser than 4294967296
      When the user requests all "<node type>"s
      Then the property "id" of all items in the response should be a number greater than 0
      And the property "id" of all items in the response should be a number lesser than 4294967296

      Examples:
        | node type     |
        | COMPANY       |
        | BRAND         |
        | CAR MODEL     |
        | RACE TRACK    |
        | TRACK LAYOUT  |
        | RACING SERIES |
        | RACING EVENT  |
        | IMAGE         |
