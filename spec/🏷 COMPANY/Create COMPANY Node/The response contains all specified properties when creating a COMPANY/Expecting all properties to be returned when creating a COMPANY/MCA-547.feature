    @TEST_MCA-547 @implemented
    Scenario: Expecting all properties to be returned when creating a COMPANY
      When the user creates a "COMPANY" "BMW AG" with the following data
        | key                         | value  |
        | name                        | BMW AG |
        | founded                     | 1916   |
        | defunct                     |        |
        | headquarters_location       | Munich |
        | hq_country_code             | DE     |
        | legal_headquarters_location | Munich |
        | legal_hq_country_code       | DE     |
      Then the response should contain the following properties
        | key                         | value  | datatype |
        | name                        | BMW AG | string   |
        | founded                     | 1916   | number   |
        | defunct                     |        | number   |
        | headquarters_location       | Munich | string   |
        | hq_country_code             | DE     | string   |
        | legal_headquarters_location | Munich | string   |
        | legal_hq_country_code       | DE     | string   |
