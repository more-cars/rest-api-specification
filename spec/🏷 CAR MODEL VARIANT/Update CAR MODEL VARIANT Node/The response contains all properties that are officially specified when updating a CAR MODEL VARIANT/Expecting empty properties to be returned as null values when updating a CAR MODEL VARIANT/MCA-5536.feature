Feature: Update CAR MODEL VARIANT Node
  As an API contributor
  I want to be able to update a CAR MODEL VARIANT
  So I can add missing information or fix incorrect data

  @RULE_MCA-5534
  Rule: The response contains all properties that are officially specified when updating a CAR MODEL VARIANT

    @TEST_MCA-5536 @implemented
    Scenario: Expecting empty properties to be returned as null values when updating a CAR MODEL VARIANT
      Given there exists a "CAR MODEL VARIANT" "BMW M3 CSL"
      When the user updates the node "BMW M3 CSL" with the following data
        | key                    | value    |
        | name                   | BMW M3_2 |

        | doors                  |          |

      Then the response should contain the following properties
